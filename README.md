# HazelEngine
A GAME ENGINE

HazelEngine is a 2D Rendering engine that is capable of making 2d games and 2d desktop applications.

First run "GenerateProjectFiles.bat" then the appropriate project files will be created (vs2019 files)
then launch the .sln file and then build and run the application using vs2019.
